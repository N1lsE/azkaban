This is my attempt on a password manager.

I plan on writing it in c (to learn c) and maby later use some FFI (to learn FFI)

Planed features:

- Password generation
- Log in with YubiKey
- multiple YubiKey support
- save passwords, notes, images, documents
- be in one file so you can back up it easily
- probably no backup log in method because screw you.
  You should have registered multiple YubiKeys and backed up one of them!
